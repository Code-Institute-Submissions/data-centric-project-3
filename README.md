# User Centric Frontend Milestone Project-The Monkees.

My website about the rock band-The Monkees-is a simple and minimalist yet contains all the necessary aspects of the project. It is made up of 1 main 
page that is then divided into 5 equal sections that are representing different areas of this project. These 5 sections are: Home-which is the opening of the website,
About-contains information about the history of the band as well as a description for each of the band members, Gallery- this contains a few pictures of the band, Our hits!- this is the part that contains 
some of their best hits, contact-where the users can contact the band. Oue next stop!- is a concert schedule that opens in a new page. 


# UX:

This website is eassentially made for the band's fanbase or anyone aiming to learn about them. 
My page contains all the needed information that the users would like to know about the band, simply stated and presented. 
Using less technical words, as it targets users of a wide age range. So, the page makes it easier for them to learn about their favourite band.
It also includes a contact section where the users could hire them or even leave messages for them; therefore, this provides a good user experience.
The built-up/design of this website is based on the following User Experiences/stories:

1)As a user, I should be able to understand the terms used in the website,in order to carry on any tasks.
2)As a fan, there should be a website dedicated to my favourite band,so that i do not have to look for their information on other websites. 
3) As a user, I would like to expand images, to see images clearer.
"The Mockup used to build this website is monkees.bmpr which is included with files on GitHub." 

# Features:

# Existing Features:

Home- The home part comes with video playing as a loop, the video is muted in order not to interfere with other audios played by the users. 
also, the navigation bar is fixed to allow the user to know what part of the website they are on and provide them with a choice to go on other sections whilst they on one.

About-The About section gives a little information about the background of the band, and describes each of the members with an image on top of each description.

Gallery- This section is like a photo album of the band, it has small size images which could be expanded by clicking on them.
it comes with a close button to allow the user to exit the expanded image.

Our Hits! - This section provides the user with 3 of the best band's songs which they could play and listen to.

Contact- In the contact section a form is given that the users should fill if they wish to hire/send messages to the band by mentioning the purpose of their message.
In this section as well, social links are provided for the user to find them on social media and interact. 

Our Next Stop!- this is the last page of the website and it opens in a new page, it show an events/concerts schedule in a table with information about the location and dates.

# Features left to implement:

1)There could be a Sign-in/Sign-Up page or a newsletter added for users who would like to stay updated to any new additions on the website.


2) On the page that shows concerts schedule,  there could a "Buy tickets" section for those who intend to attend their concerts.
And this could make it easier to purchase tickets instead of looking for them on other websites.


# Technologies Used:

In this project, I have used multiple languages and frameworks. Such as: HTML5,CSS were used to write the code and design it and Javascript was added to give functionality to some aspects.
Frameworks like Bootstrap was added to help out with the layout design and make the website look better and satisfy the user experience. 
A library such as W3Schools helped in identifying the style and the understanding of some features implemented in the website. 
JQuery was also used to make it easier to use Javascript on the website.

# Testing:

My website was tested using various methods, including the "Inscpect" feature on the browser and choosing different devices.
Responsinator was also used in the testing to make sure the content shows on different device sizes. 
According to the User Experiences mentioned in the UX section, the users wanted content that is easily understood and a page that contains enough information about the band.
That was achieved in my website, by providing an easy-flow page with enough information and least usage of technical words.

Not only those but also scenarios such as:

Gallery:
1) Go to Gallery section.

2) Click on one of the images.

3) The image will be expanded.

4) A close button is provided to be able to close the image if no longer needed.


The look of my website on different sized devices and browsers is as follows:

Large Screens(for example-Desktop screen):

1) The navigation bar is shown as full nav bar.
2) The images in the gallery are shown inline.
3) The hits are shown in a horizontal line.

Medium Screens (for example-Ipad Portrait view or Iphone landscape view):

1)The navigation bar becomes a dropdown/Hamburger menu.
2) The images in the gallery are shown as two on each line.
3) The hits switch a vertical alignment.

Small Screens (for example: Mobile phone portrait view):

1) The navigation stays as a dropdown menu.
2) The images switch to a vertical alignment.
3) The hits switch back to horizontal alignment but closer together.


Bugs:

The alignment of the Hits section in smaller screens overides eachother.
The social links become vertical/ look as a triangle in smaller screen sizes.


# Deployment:

The process of deploying the project to GitHub was as follows:
1) After successfully pushing the files to GitHub,start the deployment. 

2)I went on settings and to the page section, changed the branch name to Master Branch.

3) A link was operated and that was the Live URL to my website.


Deployment: is making the website Live and accessible by anyone who opens the link provided.

Development: is using Git commands to upload the file used in the making of the website to GitHub in order to be downloaded or viewed by the assesor and checked.


To run my code locally, and ensure that it perfectly works, the user should download the source files used along with the HTML code and run it on their device.
